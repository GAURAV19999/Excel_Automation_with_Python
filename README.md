# Excel_Automation_with_Python

* This is a compilation of projects, with randomized data, where Python is
being used to automate work flows within a preexisting Excel file.
* The scripts are for Windows systems with Excel installed
* If you don't have Python installed, I recommend installing the 64-bit
Anaconda distribution with Python 3.xx from: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
* These scripts will not support legacy Python
